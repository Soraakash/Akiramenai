// You are given a 0-indexed array nums of size n consisting of non-negative integers.

// You need to apply n - 1 operations to this array where, in the ith operation (0-indexed), you will apply the following on the ith element of nums:

// If nums[i] == nums[i + 1], then multiply nums[i] by 2 and set nums[i + 1] to 0. Otherwise, you skip this operation.
// After performing all the operations, shift all the 0's to the end of the array.

// For example, the array [1,0,2,0,0,1] after shifting all its 0's to the end, is [1,2,1,0,0,0].
// Return the resulting array.

// Note that the operations are applied sequentially, not all at once.


// Example 1:
// Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]
// Output: [1,4,2,0,0,0]
// Explanation: We do the following operations:
// - i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
// - i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0].
// - i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
// - i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
// - i = 4: nums[4] and nums[5] are equal, we multiply nums[4] by 2 and change nums[5] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
// After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array [1,4,2,0,0,0].
